# AngularTourOfHeroes

This project is the result of the angular tutorial: [Angular tour of heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial)

##Motivation

I created this repo to share this project I worked on some time ago to learn Angular and redo what I did following the tutorial.

##Tech/Framework

Angular 9:
-Typescript
-HTML
-CSS

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
